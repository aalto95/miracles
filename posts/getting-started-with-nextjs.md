# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes building full-stack web applications easier than ever.

## Why Next.js?

- **Server-side Rendering**: Build fast, SEO-friendly applications
- **API Routes**: Create backend endpoints without a separate server
- **File-based Routing**: Intuitive routing without complex configuration
- **Automatic Optimization**: Images, fonts, and scripts are optimized out of the box

## Installation

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Project Structure

```
my-app/
├── app/
│   ├── page.tsx
│   └── layout.tsx
├── public/
├── package.json
└── next.config.ts
```

## Next Steps

Start by editing `app/page.tsx` and see your changes in real-time with hot reload!
